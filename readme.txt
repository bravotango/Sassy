Gulp is a tool to compile SASS into CSS
open folder in visual studio code
html boiler code = create.html line1, !
install "Live Sass Compiler" - visual studio code
"watch sass" in bottom of visual studio code
caniuse.com - variables work 87% CSS3 browsers without needing sass
https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/ - shape effects with CSS - polygons, octogons, rhombus, etc.
CSS3 Grid, is one of the best new things

I would love to join a team working with Visual Studio Code as the editor.  I really enjoy the speed of development in this IDE.
I would love to pe a part of a team innovating with Node.js, Angular, Angular Material, SCSS/SASS, and CSS3 animations
